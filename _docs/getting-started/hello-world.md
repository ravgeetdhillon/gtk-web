# Getting Started

GTK is a widget toolkit. Each user interface created by GTK consists of
widgets. This is implemented in C using GObject, an object-oriented
framework for C. Widgets are organized in a hierarchy. The window widget is
the main container. The user interface is then built by adding buttons,
drop-down menus, input fields, and other widgets to the window. If you are
creating complex user interfaces it is recommended to use GtkBuilder and its
GTK-specific markup description language, instead of assembling the
interface manually. You can also use a visual user interface editor, like
Glade.

GTK is event-driven. The toolkit listens for events such as a click on a
button, and passes the event to your application.

Below are some examples to get you started with GTK programming.

## Hello World App in C

![Hello World Application in GTK using C](/assets/img/docs/docs-hello-world-c.png)

To begin our introduction to GTK, we'll start with a simple `Hello World` GTK application.

Create a new file with the following content named `hello-world-gtk.c`.

```c
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

static void
print_hello (GtkWidget *widget,
             gpointer   data)
{
  g_print ("Hello World\n");
}

static void
activate (GtkApplication *app,
          gpointer        user_data)
{
  GtkWidget *window;
  GtkWidget *button;

  window = gtk_application_window_new (app);
  gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), "Window");
  gtk_window_set_default_size (GTK_WINDOW (window), 200, 200);

  button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Hello World");
  g_signal_connect (button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK (print_hello), NULL);
  gtk_window_set_child (GTK_WINDOW (window), button);

  gtk_window_present (GTK_WINDOW (window));
}

int
main (int    argc,
      char **argv)
{
  GtkApplication *app;
  int status;

  app = gtk_application_new ("org.gtk.example", G_APPLICATION_FLAGS_NONE);
  g_signal_connect (app, "activate", G_CALLBACK (activate), NULL);
  status = g_application_run (G_APPLICATION (app), argc, argv);
  g_object_unref (app);

  return status;
}
```

You can compile the program above with GCC using:

```shell
gcc -o hello-world-gtk hello-world-gtk.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk4`
```

## Explanation

### Initialising the App

In a GTK application, the purpose of the `main()` function is to create a
[`GtkApplication`](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Application.html)
object and run it. In this example a `GtkApplication` instance is created and
initialized using `gtk_application_new()`.

When creating a `GtkApplication` you need to pick an application identifier
(a name) and input to `gtk_application_new()` as parameter. For this
example, `org.gtk.example` is used but for choosing an identifier for your
application see [this guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/ChooseApplicationID).
Lastly `gtk_application_new()` takes a `GApplicationFlags` argument, which
control some of the capabilities that your application has, like being able
to open files specified on the command line, or parsing command line options.

Next the activate signal is connected to the `activate()` function above the
`main()` functions. The activate signal will be sent when your application
is launched with `g_application_run()` on the line below. The
`gtk_application_run()` also takes as arguments the pointers to the command
line arguments counter and string array; this allows GTK to parse specific
command line arguments that control the behavior of GTK itself. The parsed
arguments will be removed from the array, leaving the unrecognized ones for
your application to parse.

Within `g_application_run` the `activate()` signal is sent and we then
proceed into the `activate()` function of the application. Inside the
`activate()` function we want to construct our GTK window, so that a window
is shown when the application is launched. The call to
`gtk_application_window_new()` will create a new
[`GtkApplicationWindow`](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.ApplicationWindow.html)
instance and store it inside the `window` pointer. The window will have a frame,
a title bar, and window controls depending on the platform.

A window title is set using `gtk_window_set_title()`. This function takes a
`GtkWindow` pointer and a string as input. As our window pointer is a
GtkWidget pointer, we need to cast it to `GtkWindow`. But instead of
casting window via the usual C cast operator `(GtkWindow *)`, `window` should
be cast using the `GTK_WINDOW()` macro. `GTK_WINDOW()` will perform a run
time check if the pointer is an instance of the `GtkWindow` class, before
casting, and emit a warning if the check fails. More information about this
convention can be found [here](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gtype-conventions.html).

Finally the window size is set using `gtk_window_set_default_size()` and the
window is then shown by GTK via `gtk_window_present()`.

When you exit the window, by for example pressing the X, the
`g_application_run()` in the main loop returns with a number which is saved
inside an integer named "status". Afterwards, the `GtkApplication` object is
freed from memory with `g_object_unref()`. Finally the status integer is
returned to the operating system, and the GTK application exits.

### Adding Button

As seen above, `hello-world-gtk.c` adds a button to our window, with the
label "Hello World". A new `GtkWidget` pointer is declared to accomplish
this, `button`, and is initialized by calling `gtk_button_new_with_label()`,
which returns a [`GtkButton`](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Button.html)
to be stored inside `button`. Afterwards `button` is added to our `window`.
Using `g_signal_connect` the button is connected to a function in our app
called `print_hello()`, so that when the button is clicked, GTK will call
this function. As the `print_hello()` function does not use any data as
input, NULL is passed to it. `print_hello()` calls `g_print()` with the
string "Hello World" which will print Hello World in a terminal if the GTK
application was started from one.

## Next steps

The GTK documentation contains a full example on how to create [a complex
application](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/getting_started.html#building-applications),
capable of opening files, storing and loading settings, using menus and more
complex widgets.
